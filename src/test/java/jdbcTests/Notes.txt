JDBC + SQL Queries
- How to verify UI Data from Database Information

JDBC: Java Database Connectivity, API middle man, transfers your Java code into Database Env
Database Testing
Java Code  ----->  JDBC  ----->  Driver (Specific to Database Management System, Oracle, PostgreSQL...)  ------>  Database Part

WebPage Testing
JAVA  -----> Selenium  ----> WebDriverManager(this brings us necessary driver) ---> Connect Browser


JDBC needs specific Driver to connect
for Oracle we add this dependency to our pom.xml file
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.oracle.ojdbc</groupId>
            <artifactId>ojdbc8</artifactId>
            <version>19.3.0.0</version>
        </dependency>

Please use the same IP that you have for Jenkins/HR Database

To reach Spartans WebPage: 3.85.201.5:8000
To connect Spartans Database
IP: 3.85.201.5. or you own EC2 Machine public ip
Username:SP
Password:SP

Two Point Verification:  UI versus DB
A change in the UI can be verified from DB part and vice verse

To connect DB with JDBC we need followings:
1. Driver
2. Connection String:
            String dbUrl = "jdbc:oracle:thin:@3.85.201.5:1521:xe";
            String dbUsername = "hr";
            String dbPassword = "hr";
3. We need three steps to execute our query and get result
    Connection connection:  establishes connection
    Statement statement :  sends your query to DB
    ResultSet resultSet : we use to manipulate query result

    resultSet.next(): takes your curser to the next row inside result table
    resultSet.getObject(1): Takes the value of column 1 of that row
